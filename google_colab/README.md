# Google colab

## Requirements

- Our folder google drive folder MALWIAS with all the datasets and models (models only to go faster, not mandatory)
- Create a direct link of MALWIAS to your My Drive folder

[Random Forest](RandomForest.ipynb) algorithm is the best one that we got and so the best documented.

## All ML models

- [Decision Trees](Decision_Trees.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression.ipynb)
- [Multi-layer Perceptron classifier](MLPClassifier.ipynb)
- [Naive Bayes](Naive_Bayes.ipynb)
- [Random Forest](RandomForest.ipynb): Best result
- [Epsilon-Support Vector Regression](SVR.ipynb)
